#' @title gmvarkit: Estimate Gaussian Mixture Vector Autoregressive (GMVAR) model
#'
#' @description \code{gmvarkit} is a package for estimating Gaussian Mixture Vector Autoregressive (GMVAR) model.
#'   It provides functions for unconstrained and constraints maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters,
#'   quantile residuals tests, graphical diagnostics, simulation from the processes, and forecasting.
#'
#'   Most of the functions documented are not exported, but are for internal use only. The vignette
#'   is a good place to start.
